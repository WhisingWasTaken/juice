**Team Members: Whising (for now)**

**How would you pitch your game in one line?**
It's like a basic platformer with weapons!

**What is the key mechanic(s) that make it fun?**
Its a platformer with a good arenas and weapons to fight enemies with different levels, shop and characters (soonTM)

**How does the game actually play? (Core Game Loop)**
Again, platformer with abilities and weapons, like fireballs, bows, punches (obv) etc! (soonTM)

**How will you keep players engaged for 30 minutes? What's the general scope of your game (will change as you go)?**
With engaging arenas and mechanics with attractable UI and design, the game will get harder as you go, it will have 3 areas, grassy, snowy and
snowy, with 10 levels each in total 30 levels, and then 5 level boss fights which will get you the most rewards!
